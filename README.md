# Linear-Regression-Assumptions

Linear regression model requires a list of assumptions to be met, otherwise it will be valid neither for prediction nor for interpretation. Those assumptions are

* **Linearity:** *predictors and the outcome variable should have a linear relationship;*
* **Normality:** *e ~ N(0, σ<sup>2</sup>) - residuals should be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance σ<sup>2</sup>;*
* **Homoscedasticity:** *Var(e<sub>i</sub>) = σ<sup>2</sup> - constant variance of error term;*
* **Absence of Collinearity:** *predictors should not be strongly or perfectly correlated with each other;*
* **Independence:** *uncorrelated error terms.*

Violation of each assumption will entail different consequences.
The aim of the project is to consider a few examples of linear regression models with a corresponding check of assumptions. If assumptions are violated, a few steps will be taken to solve the problems.
